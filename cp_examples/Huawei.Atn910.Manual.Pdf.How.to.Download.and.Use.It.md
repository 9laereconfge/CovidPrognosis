Some of the main features of the Huawei Atn910 series are:

- Large capacity and high performance: The Huawei Atn910 series supports up to 12x10GE ports and has a switching capacity of up to 136 Gbit/s. It can meet the needs of 4G/5G networks and protect customer investment. It also has a large buffer of up to 740 MB to handle network traffic bursts and improve user experience.
- High-quality service and high-reliability network: The Huawei Atn910 series supports various protection technologies such as IP FRR, LDP FRR, TE HSB, VPN FRR, and TI-LFA to implement node-, link-, and network-level protection. It also supports hardware-based OAM and BFD for everything to detect faults within milliseconds and trigger fast switchover. It supports 1588v2, G.8275.1 full-mode, 1588 ACR, and synchronous Ethernet clock to meet high-precision clock synchronization requirements.
- Agile O&M and intelligent network: The Huawei Atn910 series supports in-band flow detection within milliseconds through the innovative iFIT technology, which works with iMaster NCE to implement correlation analysis of service experience and network KPIs, allowing faults to be intelligently demarcated within minutes. It also supports plug-and-play and automated service provisioning and centrally manages and controls IP RAN devices through iMaster NCE for E2E service provisioning within minutes and SLA visualization.
- Programmable NP architecture and smooth network evolution: The Huawei Atn910 series adopts the programmable NP architecture, which supports interworking and coexistence of traditional MPLS and SR-MPLS/SRv6, and enables smooth network evolution. It also supports EVPN, FlexE, and other advanced features to enhance network capabilities.

The Huawei Atn910 series is widely used in global mobile transport scenarios, serving more than 130 top carriers worldwide. It has helped carriers greatly reduce network construction TCO, and improve service deployment and network O&M efficiency.
