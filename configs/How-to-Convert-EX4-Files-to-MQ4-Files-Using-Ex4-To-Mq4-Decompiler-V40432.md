Most developers will not share their source code, but some might offer you a license or a custom version of their program.

## How to Decompile EX4 Files Legally and Ethically
 
If you still want to decompile EX4 files for educational purposes, there are some ways to do it legally and ethically. Here are some of them:

- **Use open-source programs.** Instead of using closed-source programs that come with EX4 files only, you can use open-source programs that come with both EX4 and MQ4 files.
